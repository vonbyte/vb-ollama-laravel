- Code blocks are displayed with syntax highlighting appropriate to the language
- Cards have clear visual separation and consistent styling

### Performance Metrics Criteria:
- Response time is displayed in seconds with two decimal precision
- Start and end timestamps are shown for each generation
- Progress indicator shows generation in progress
- Response speed is visualized using a color scale (green=fast, red=slow)
- If available, token count and tokens-per-second are displayed
- Memory usage metrics are shown if the information is available
- Relative performance between models is visualized with a simple bar chart
- Results can be sorted by performance metrics

### Difference Highlighting Criteria:
- A toggle switch enables/disables difference highlighting
- Common text between all outputs is shown in normal styling
- Text unique to one model is highlighted in model-specific color
- Similar phrasings across models are indicated with lighter highlighting
- Word-level and sentence-level difference modes are available
- Highlighting preserves text readability (sufficient contrast)
- A difference summary shows percentage of unique content per model
- Users can click on highlighted sections to focus on specific differences

## 3. Model Management

### Story:
 As a user, I want to easily view and filter available models, so I can choose which to compare.

### Model Listing Criteria:
- Complete list of locally installed models is automatically loaded on page load
- Each model entry shows: name, size, last modified date
- A manual refresh button updates the model list
- Models can be filtered by size ranges (<1GB, 1-5GB, 5GB+)
- Models can be filtered by type using tags or categories
- Search box allows filtering by model name
- Recently used models appear at the top or are distinctly marked
- Total count of available models is displayed
- Error message appears if Ollama service is unavailable
- List updates automatically when new models are detected

## 4. History and Storage

### Story:
 As a user, I want to save, revisit, and manage my comparison history.

### Saving Criteria:
- Each comparison can be saved with a single click
- Optional title field defaults to truncated prompt text
- Optional notes field allows for contextual information
- Saved comparisons receive a unique identifier
- Confirmation message appears when comparison is saved
- Duplicate saves are prevented or user is notified
- Save time and date are recorded
- All comparison data is stored (prompt, models, outputs, metrics)

### History Management Criteria:
- History page shows minimum of 30 most recent comparisons
- Each history entry shows: title, models used, date/time, preview of prompt
- History can be sorted by date, title, or models used
- History can be filtered by model or text search
- Individual items can be deleted with confirmation
- Bulk delete option is available with confirmation
- History can be exported as JSON file
- Exported history can be imported back into the application
- History entries allow "rerun with same models" functionality
- History entries allow "rerun with different models" functionality
- Navigation between history and comparison views is seamless

## 5. Analysis Tools

### Story:
 As a user, I want to analyze and share model performance for different use cases.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Each output can be rated on a 5-star scale
- Rating summary shows average rating per model across all saved comparisons
- User can add notes to individual outputs
- User can categorize outputs with predefined or custom tags
- Tags are searchable and can be used for filtering history
- Feedback form captures structured information about output quality
- Comparison page includes a "findings" section for overall notes
- User can mark specific parts of responses as particularly good or problematic

### Export and Sharing Criteria:
- Full comparison can be exported as JSON with a single click
- Comparison can be exported as Markdown with proper formatting
- Export includes all metadata (timing, models, parameters, ratings)
- Share link functionality creates a local URL for sharing (if multi-user)
- Export options include "with highlighting" or "plain text"
- PDF export option with configurable formatting
- Exported files use a consistent naming convention
- Export action is confirmed with a success message and file information

## 6. User Experience

### Story:
 As a user, I want an intuitive, responsive interface that works on all devices.

### Responsive Design Criteria:
- Interface functions on screen sizes from 320px to 2560px
- Layouts adapt appropriately: side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile/tablet
- All interactive elements are properly sized for touch interfaces (min 44Ã—44px)
- Critical functions are accessible without horizontal scrolling on any device
- Font sizes adjust appropriately for different screen sizes
- Tables and data displays reformat for narrow screens
- All functionality is available on both mobile and desktop
- Performance remains smooth on lower-end devices

### Theme Support Criteria:

## 7. Technical Performance

### Story:
 As a user, I want a reliable, fast application that handles model interactions efficiently.

### Performance Criteria:
- Initial page load completes in under 3 seconds on average connections
- Model list loads within 1 second
- UI remains responsive during model processing
- Streaming responses appear progressively when supported
- Long-running model processes (>30s) provide progress updates
- Application gracefully handles model timeouts with clear error messages
- Failed requests can be retried without losing context
- System automatically retries on common transient errors
- Concurrent model processing is supported where Ollama allows
- Application functions offline for viewing saved comparisons
- Session data is preserved in case of browser crash or connection loss
